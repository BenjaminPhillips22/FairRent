    "#### Problem and Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "When my housemates and I moved into our new home, we had to decide who would get which room and at what price. The rooms were different sizes and one had an ensuite, so it wouldn’t be fair to split the rent equally between us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I will present a potential method for assigning and pricing the rooms.\n",
    "The housemates individually (and privately) determine what they would value each room at, with these values adding up to the total rent. For example, if the monthly rent for the house is \\$1000 a month, housemate 1 may value room 1 at \\$200, room 2 at \\$300 and room 3 at \\$500. It is important not to think of these values as bids, but rather what the housemate would be happy to pay if they were assigned to that room.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective function for this problem is to maximise the minimum utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "I define ‘Utility’ as the difference between what a housemate was willing to pay for the room assigned to them, and what they actually have to pay. For our example with housemate 1, if they are assigned to room 1 with rent being \\$150 per month, that would have a utility of \\$50.\n",
    "This objective function has several desirable outcomes for allocating rooms and determining prices. It assigns rooms to maximise the sum of what each housemate valued their assigned room at. This can be thought of as getting the most ‘value’ out of the house. Once the rooms are assigned, the sum of what each housemate valued their assigned room at will be larger than the total rent (unless all housemates had identical preferences). This means that each housemate’s rent needs to be reduced by a certain amount, what I have defined as utility. By maximising the minimum utility, we can determine the fairest way to divide the rent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, in addition to the objective, there is a constraint that makes this solution ‘Envy Free’. Room and rent are ‘envy free’ if no housemate would wish to swap rooms with anyone else. Going back to our example with housemate 1, if they were assigned room 1 at \\$150 and housemate 2 was assigned room 3 at \\$400, then housemate 1 would want to swap. Housemate 1 would have a utility of \\$50 for their assigned room but could have a utility of \\$100 (\\$400 is \\$100 less than what housemate 1 values room 3 at) if they swapped with housemate 2. This would not be an ‘envy free’ solution.\n",
